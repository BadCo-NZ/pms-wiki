# Automated Install

Full entry is a WIP.

For now, see my GitHub repo at [IronicBadger/infra](https://github.com/ironicbadger/infra) for automation code. There are several blog posts linked there about utilising that code until I get around to finishing this page.

In the meantime here's some reading material to keep you busy:
