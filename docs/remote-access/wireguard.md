# WireGuard

!!! info
    This page is a work in progress.

This page will cover two WireGuard architectures. The first is running WireGuard within your LAN and connecting to that server from a remote endpoint by punching a hole in your firewall with port forwarding. The second will require use of a satellite node running on a VPS to bounce connections through - this is the more secure and recommended route to take.
